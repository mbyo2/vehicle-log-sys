## ⚠️ Required Manual Steps

### Supabase Dashboard Configuration

1. **Enable Leaked Password Protection**
   - Navigate to: Authentication > Providers > Email > Password Protection
   - Enable: "Leaked Password Protection"
   - This prevents users from using commonly breached passwords

2. **Upgrade Postgres Version**
   - Navigate to: Settings > Infrastructure > Postgres version
   - Upgrade to the latest stable version
   - This applies important security patches

3. **Configure Auth URLs**
   - Navigate to: Authentication > URL Configuration
   - Set Site URL to your production domain
   - Add Redirect URLs for all your domains (production, staging)
   - Format: `https://yourdomain.com/**`

4. **Configure Email Provider**
   - Navigate to: Settings > Auth > Email
   - Configure SMTP settings with your email provider
   - The default Supabase email is rate-limited for production

5. **Set Up Monitoring** (Recommended)
   - Navigate to: Logs
   - Review and set up alerts for critical errors
   - Configure log retention policies

6. **Database Backups**
   - Navigate to: Settings > Backups
   - Verify automated backup schedule
   - Test backup restoration procedure

### Environment Variables

Ensure all required secrets are configured in Supabase Edge Functions:
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - For email notifications
- `APP_URL` - Your production application URL
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Service role key for edge functions

### Performance Optimization

1. **Review Console Logs**
   - Replace all `console.log` statements with the logger utility
   - Already created at `src/lib/logger.ts`
   - Import with: `import { logger } from '@/lib/logger'`
   - Use: `logger.log()`, `logger.error()`, `logger.warn()`, `logger.debug()`

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Compress and optimize all static images
   - Use appropriate image formats (WebP where supported)
   - Implement lazy loading for images

3. **Code Splitting**
   - Review bundle size
   - Implement code splitting for large components
   - Use dynamic imports where appropriate

4. **Database Query Optimization**
   - Review slow query logs
   - Add indexes where needed
   - Optimize complex queries

### Testing

1. **User Acceptance Testing**
   - Test all user flows end-to-end
   - Verify all roles work correctly (super_admin, company_admin, supervisor, driver)
   - Test on different devices and browsers

2. **Security Testing**
   - Penetration testing (recommended)
   - Verify RLS policies work correctly
   - Test rate limiting
   - Verify no data leakage between companies

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Load testing with expected user volume
   - Test with realistic data volumes
   - Monitor database performance

### Monitoring & Analytics

1. **Error Tracking**
   - Integrate with Sentry or similar (recommended)
   - Configure error alerts
   - Set up error grouping and prioritization

2. **Analytics**
   - Integrate Google Analytics or similar
   - Set up conversion tracking
   - Monitor user behavior

3. **Uptime Monitoring**
   - Set up uptime monitoring (Pingdom, UptimeRobot, etc.)
   - Configure alerts for downtime
   - Set up status page

### Compliance & Legal

1. **Privacy Policy**
   - Create and publish privacy policy
   - Ensure GDPR compliance if serving EU users
   - Implement data subject rights (access, deletion)

2. **Terms of Service**
   - Create and publish terms of service
   - Add cookie consent banner if needed

3. **Data Retention**
   - Define data retention policies
   - Implement automated data cleanup
   - Document data handling procedures

### Documentation

1. **User Documentation**
   - Create user guides for each role
   - Document common workflows
   - Create FAQ section

2. **Admin Documentation**
   - Document admin procedures
   - Create runbooks for common issues
   - Document backup/restore procedures

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Pre-deployment**
   - Run all tests
   - Verify all environment variables
   - Create database backup
   - Review recent changes

2. **Deploy**
   - Deploy to production
   - Verify deployment successful
   - Check error logs

3. **Post-deployment**
   - Smoke test critical paths
   - Monitor error rates
   - Check performance metrics
   - Verify backups running

4. **Rollback Plan**
   - Document rollback procedure
   - Keep previous version accessible
   - Monitor for 24 hours post-deployment
